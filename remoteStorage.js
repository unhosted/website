the file you are looking for is here:
https://github.com/unhosted/remoteStorage.js

unhosted.org is hosted on nodejitsu, with a http server that is here:
https://github.com/unhosted/experiments/tree/master/localhostServer
and that merges the 'website' repo and the 'remoteStorage.js' repo into one, depending on which file path you request.
