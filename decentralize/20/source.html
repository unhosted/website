<h3>Virtualization of sessions</h3>
<p>A sound system can usually be operated by whoever has physical access to it. This is a very simple system which humans understand well. If you
want only the DJ to play music, then you just construct a physical DJ booth, and people naturally sense that they're not allowed to enter it, or to
lean over the table from the other side. For gaming consoles and PCs this can also still work. Laptops usually have a password-protected lock screen,
which means a thief of the physical object can't access the data on there. And shared computers will have multiple user accounts, with or without
admin (root) access to the device's configuration.</p>
<p>This means that a single device often already provides a concept of accounts and sessions: a session is one user currently using the device, and
during such a session, the user has unemcumbered access both to the device's capabilities, and to that user's own data. A session is started by providing
some sort of account credentials, and exists for a finite contiguous timespan.</p>
<p>When you connect computers with each other into a network, all of this becomes immensely more complicated. First of all, physical access is no longer
needed to open a session on a device, and largely because of this, there can be multiple sessions active simultaneously on the same device.</p>
<p>Most networking protocols provide a way to establish such remote sessions. This is sufficient if a user habitually uses the same client device to log
in to the same server device. But the virtualization and decentralization of applications and services we use in everyday life introduces two problems.
First, we need to log in to many different servers, and managing all those credentials becomes a complicated task.</p>

<h3>Client-side master sessions</h3>
<p>A simple solution for this is to store a "master session" on the client device, which can give access to an unlimited number of remote server sessions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID">WebID</a> is based on this idea: you create an asymmetric key pair inside your browser profile on your favorite
client device, and use that to establish remote sessions at servers that support WebID. The same setup is often used for ssh, git, and other
protocols that support asymmetric cryptography.</p>
<p>But this also brings us to the second problem: we increasingly want to log in <em>from</em> many different clients. You can link your account on a
client device to your remote accounts on thirty different services, but then you can access your remote accounts only from that one client device.</p>
<p>A first step to solving this is to "sync" devices with each other.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_synchronizers">Browser synchronizers</a> like Firefox Sync
allow you to synchronize your laptop's master session between for
instance your laptop and your smartphone. I'm not sure whether any of them also sync your client-side SSL certificates, but let's imagine they do.
For some people this is a great solution, because you can use multiple client devices, and always have seamless access to all your server-side accounts
and sessions. Also, having your master session synchronized over multiple client devices, automatically acts as a backup of all these credentials.</p>
<p>But whether or not this is a good enough way to organize your decentralized user accounts, heavily depends on your usage patterns.
A lot of people (for instance the kids at village internet cafes
  in rural Bali) don't own their own client device. They just use a random public computer when they need to access any of their server-side accounts.
  Also, many people
want to be able to use a random client device to access their stuff under special circumstances, for instance, when travelling. This is where the client-side
master session breaks down as a viable solution.</p>

<h3>Federated login</h3>
<p>If you want to have less different credentials for many servers where you have accounts, but you don't want to rely on any particular client device or
  set of client devices, then federated login is another possible solution. For instance, if you have your own server, then you can create your master
  session on there, and use it as a
  <a href="http://blog.industrialdefender.com/?p=612">jump box</a>, a server you can reach from any client device, and from there have your access to 
  all the other servers you may need to open sessions on.</p>
<p>Application providers could provide free jump box functionality to all their users, and that way they would effectively
  be "federated": you promote one your remote accounts to become the master account from which all your other accounts are reachable.</p>
<p>The server that is in the middle, in the jump box role, is then seen to provide "identity": you log in to control an imaginary puppet on that server,
  and that puppet (your online identity) then logs into the eventual session you want to use. Through clever tricks it's even possible to use the intermediate
  server only to establish trust during the <em>session setup</em>
  between the client and the application server, and not throughout the duration of the remote session.
  This is why such a federated jump box service is also known as an identity provider.</p>
<p>If all servers where you want to establish remote sessions support
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a>, then you can promote one of these servers by making it your identity provider,
  and use the trust between these servers to log in with that identity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many servers do not provide OpenID, when they do they often only accept a certain whitelist of identity providers, and the process of using
  OpenID to log in on a website is often confusing and cumbersome, which in turn has hindered adoption.</p>
<p>Native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Persona">Persona</a> with a primary identity provider is better than OpenID in its user interface, because it
  uses the browser chrome to transport trust between two open browser tabs. In case none of your remote accounts are Persona primaries, there is also a
  centralized secondary identity provider which allows you to create an identity account, bootstrapped from your email account.</p>
<p>In fact, the way Persona is presented to the user, the assumption is that you will use your main email address
  as your online identity. This makes sense because
  a lot of online services provide email-based password resets anyway, which already turns your primary email adress into your de facto identity provider.</p>
<p>Within enterprise intranets, services are often linked together using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">SAML</a>,
  which is a well-established framework for federated login, but which was designed for closed ecosystems instead of open ones, so that makes it more suitable
  for use on intranets than for use on the internet as a whole.</p>

<h3>Own your identity</h3>
<p>In practice, at the time of writing, Facebook Connect is probably the most popular cross-origin
  login scheme. It is proprietary and centralized, and together with
  the Facebook Like button, it gives Facebook mighty powers over the web as a whole. Some other application providers provide comparable niche
  schemes, like logging in with Twitter and logging in with Github. Many relying parties seem to have replaced their "log in with OpenID" button with a
  "log in with Google" button.</p>
<p>This is a big problem, of course. As I already emphasized in previous episodes, your online identity should derive
  directly from a DNS domain name that you own.</p>
<p>This also allows you to host your own public profile, with some basic public information about yourself, as a web page.
  At the same time you can then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webfinger">Webfinger</a> to provide a machine-readable version of that same
  public profile page. And of course, you should add email hosting
  to your domain name, and become your own OpenID provider, as well as your own Persona provider, on your own DNS domain name.</p>
<p>That is the only proper way to deal with identity on the web: don't outsource your identity to Facebook or Google, own it yourself!</p>

<h3>And the ultimate solution...: don't log in!</h3>
<p>All this talk about logging in to hosted sessions, disgusting! ;) Our goal with remoteStorage, Sockethub, unhosted web apps, and the
  <a href="http://nobackend.org/">noBackend</a> movement in general, is of course to decentralize applications away from specific application servers, meaning
  you don't have to log in to an application-specific server at all.</p>
<p>When you use an unhosted web app, you do not log in to the application. Instead you <em>connect</em> the application, which runs client-side, to your
  own <em>per-user server</em>. This completely eradicates hosted applications, and with it the problem of logging in to many different hosted applications.</p>
<p>Identity is not a problem in unhosted applications: there are no per-application sessions, only per-user sessions. Still, I wanted to dedicate an episode
  to it, since it's an important background topic, and we often get the question "how do unhosted web apps interact with Persona". So now you know.
  The answer is: they don't have the problem that Persona solves. :)</p>
