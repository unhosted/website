					<h2>Freedom from web 2.0's monopoly platforms</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted is an Open Source project aiming to provide users with their own share of online resources</strong>, thus making it perfect for altruistic websites and for bringing public domain applications to the web.

				<h3>How does unhosted work?</h3>
				<div id="explanation">
					<p>
						A website is a specific web app, <strong>hosted</strong> on a specific server farm. There is a limited number of <strong>big centralized websites</strong>, that we all connect to. Our web has been taken hostage and <strong>monopolized</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted web apps</strong> are not hosted on one specific server farm. They are freed. The once-important server farms now <strong>become commodity</strong> infrastructure, and authors of unhosted web apps <strong>liberate the user</strong>.

					<p>
						We are pleased to announce that <strong>Unhosted's 'Hacky Holidays' competition</strong>  is on! The deadline is <strong>New Year's Day 2011</strong>. If you are able to write an unhosted web app during those boring Christmas days, then you will be one of the first people in the world to have done that, and additionally, if your app is really cool, then you'll win one of three plug servers (<a href="http://www.tonidoplug.com/" target="_blank">http://www.tonidoplug.com/</a> or any similar one you prefer). If you don't know what unhosted is, read our <a href="manifesto.html">manifesto</a> first. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Get our <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/tarball/v0.1">tarball</a> from github and play around with the 'hello world' examples. There is one Pub/Sub-model example and one messaging-model example. From there, take your inspiration and put a cool app together. If you get stuck with how to do something and want some advice, ask your questions on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unhosted" target="_blank">mailing list</a> and we'll answer them there. The third example is about cryptography and especially for the ubergeeks among us, but you won't need that one to win.
					</p>
					<p>	
						To make an unhosted web app work, you need to program all functionality client-side, and in a distributed architecture, so a bit of JavaScript skills come in handy, as does experience with scalability design. It's the perfect puzzle challenge for frontend developers, backend developers, sysadmins, and everyone inbetween! :) Linux-based plug servers are just about as cool as a geeky gadget can get. So we really hope you think of a cool app you could write into a distributed client-side form, and have a Hacky Holiday!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Separate categories for webdevs and geeks are on the right.</strong> You are encouraged to compete in more than one category, to increase your chances of winning one of the three desirable plug servers. <a href="HackyHolidays.html">Deadline</a>: <strong>New Year's Day 2011.</strong>

							<strong>Be the first person to write an unhosted WebApp!</strong> twitter, chat, farmville, poker, forum, webmail, whatever you can hack together with your web development and JavaScript skills. 
						</p>
						<p>
						You can use the hello-world examples from the <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/tarball/v0.1">tarball</a> as a starting point. They include a Pub/Sub-model wappblog and a messaging-based wappmail example.

						<p>
							<strong>The <a href="protocol.html">UJ/0.1 protocol</a> and the <a href="StarSign.html">StarSign0.1 pki</a> are very basic, and there are many things that can (and probably should) be added to them.</strong> Like support for federation, compatibility with CCN, improvement of security, designing a browser to browser discovery & friending mechanism, etcetera.
