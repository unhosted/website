	<h3>Introduction</h3> 
<p>An Unhosted WebDAV service acts as an always-on data storage
for its users. It does not host any application source code, nor does it execute
any processing.
 To make use of an Unhosted WebDAV account, the user visits unhosted web apps 
that run in a browser, or user-agent. This user-agent discovers the user's
Unhosted WebDAV service through WebFinger. It then redirects the user to an OAuth
dialogue, to establish authentication. Finally, it uses WebDAV to read and write the
data on the Unhosted WebDAV account.
</p>
<p>This document is meant for implementers of an
<strong>Unhosted WebDAV service</strong>. It descibes how an Unhosted WebDAV
service should behave. <strong>Developers</strong> of unhosted web apps should
read <a href="http://www.unhosted.org/developers.html">this page</a> instead.
<strong>End-users</strong> who are interested in understanding the concepts
behind the unhosted web, are better off reading <a
href="http://www.unhosted.org/">http://www.unhosted.org/</a>.  </p> <p> In order
for your service to comply with the Unhosted WebDAV standard, it needs to
implement <strong>WebFinger, OAuth2-cs, WebDAV, Http Basic auth, and
CORS</strong>. All of these technologies should be configured to work together
in the way that this specification describes using the keywords "MUST", "SHOULD"
and "SHOULD EITHER .. OR", in the meaning specified by <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">rcf2119</a>.  </p> <p>Throughout this
text, we use several variables, which are written in capitals, and with a $-sign
in front of them. They describe the interaction between a user, this user's
Unhosted WebDAV service (aka her unhosted account), and an application. The
variables are: <ul> <li><strong>$USERNAME</strong> - the local part of the
user's global user identifier, that's to say, the part before the '@' sign.</li>
<li><strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> - the server part of the user's global user
identifier, that's to say, the part after the '@' sign.</li>
<li><strong>$DAVURL</strong> - the base URL of the Unhosted WebDAV service.</li>
<li><strong>$APP</strong> - the URL of the application</li>
<li><strong>$RESOURCE</strong> - the string identifying the resource to which
the user is granting the application access. By default, $RESOURCE = $APP.</li>
<ul> </p>
	
	<h3 id="webFinger">WebFinger</h3> <p>The Unhosted WebDAV service MUST
implement <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/WebFingerProtocol">WebFinger</a>
 and with <a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/32686/xrd-1.0-wd01.html">XRD</a>
formatting. In the WebFinger data for <strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong>,
it should announce an https-based <strong>$DAVURL</strong> with
<strong>rel</strong>-attribute
'<strong>http://unhosted.org/spec/dav/0.1</strong>' . All WebFinger-related
resources SHOULD be served over 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">https</a> and MUST be served with <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a> headers that allow their retrieval
from any origin.  </p>
	
	<h3 id="oAuth">OAuth</h3> <p>Given the <strong>$DAVURL</strong>
announced via WebFinger, the Unhosted WebDAV implementer MUST make <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-13#section-4.2">OAuth2-cs</a>
available on <strong>$DAVURL/oauth2/auth</strong> (no need for CORS headers
here, because OAuth does redirection and not AJAX).  </p>
	
	<h3 id="webDav">WebDAV</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever a user <strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong> grants an
<strong>$APP</strong> access to a <strong>$RESOURCE</strong>, the Unhosted
WebDAV implementer MUST make a WebDAV server available on
<strong>$DAVURL/webdav/$USERDOMAIN/$USERNAME/$RESOURCE/</strong>, with CORS
headers that allow access from whichever <strong>$APP</strong> sends it valid
credentials.  </p>
	
	<p>Non-normative hint: For this, it is necessary to 
exclude (apart from the HEAD and GET verbs) the OPTIONS verb 
from the http basic auth restrictions. It is also necessary to set the
-Allow-Credentials header to true, and to echo the Origin specified in the
request headers back in the -Allow-Origin header (setting it to '*' works for
the OAuth2-cs URL, but not here, because of an extra restriction on CORS that
applies when there are credentials involved). An example of how to configure
this in apache's mod_dav can be found <a
href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/DemoRedlibreOrg">here</a>.  </p>
	
	<h3 id="basicAuth">Http basic auth</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever a user, who is successfully identified as <strong>$USERNAME
@ $USERDOMAIN</strong> by the OAuth2-cs authentication server, and has
successfully granted application <strong>$APP</strong> access to resource
<strong>$RESOURCE</strong>, the OAuth access token given out to the
<strong>$APP</strong> MUST be a valid <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">http basic auth</a> password for
<strong>$DAVURL/webdav/$USERDOMAIN/$USERNAME/$RESOURCE/</strong>, when combined
with the concatenation of <strong>$USERNAME</strong>, '<strong>@</strong>', and
<strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> as the http basic auth username.  
Http basic auth MUST be required for all verbs except OPTIONS, HEAD and GET.
This means all content on the DAV server will be read/write-able for <strong>$USERNAME
@ $USERDOMAIN</strong>, and world-readable. It is the responsibility of the application to add
a payload encryption layer on top of this (end-to-end encryption).
</p>
	
	<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3> <p>In addition to the '<a
href="http://hueniverse.com/2009/03/the-discovery-protocol-stack/">lrdd</a>'
entry that is needed in
<strong>https://$USERDOMAIN/.well-known/host-meta</strong> as part of WebFinger,
the implementer of Unhosted WebDAV SHOULD also add a '<strong>register</strong>'
entry. It should contain a template with two variables: <strong>{uri}</strong>
and <strong>{redirect_url}</strong>. It SHOULD then also offer a human-readable
web page with registration information on the URL that is constructed by filling
in the concatenation of '<strong>acct:</strong>', <strong>$USERNAME</strong>,
'<strong>@</strong>', and <strong>$USERDOMAIN</strong> for the
<strong>{uri}</strong> variable, and a redirect URL for the
<strong>{redirect_url}</strong> variable. This registration page SHOULD EITHER
allow the user to register a new unhosted account identified by
<strong>$USERNAME @ $USERDOMAIN</strong>, OR provide human-readable information
about why this is not being offered (for instance, if the username is taken, or
if the server is not currently accepting registrations, or if some out-of-band
actions are needed, like "if you are an ACME employee, but haven't received the
credentials for your unhosted account yet, then please contact the helpdesk on
it@acme.com"). Whether registration as a new user is successful or not, upon
completion the user-agent SHOULD be redirected back to the url that was filled
in as the <strong>{redirect-url}</strong> in the template.  </p>
	
	<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p> A non-normative example
implementation of this specification is currently visible by visiting the
world's first unhosted web app, on <a
href="http://www.myfavouritesandwich.org/" target="_blank">http://www.myfavouritesandwich.org/</a>, or
viewing its <a href="http://www.myfavouritesandwich.org/unhosted.js" target="_blank">javascript</a>,
and <a href="httpTrace.txt" target="_blank">here</a> is a stripped down
representation of the http trace it produces. It is up to the application, and
beyond the scope of this spec, to implement end-to-end encryption on top of
this, possibly using the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library, possibly in a
WebWorker process. This text may be changed for clarity - its history is tracked
<a
href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/webdesign/commits/master/html/spec/dav/0.1/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
However, the standard it describes was frozen on <strong>5 April 2011</strong>.
The standard will not change for at least 6 months (until at least <strong>5
October 2011</strong>). Even then, if at any point after that improvements to
this standard are deemed desirable, every attempt will be made to make those
changes non-breaking. We will follow <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">semantic versioning</a>.
