					<h3>Freedom from web 2.0's monopoly platforms</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted is a project for strengthening free software against hosted software</strong>. With our protocol, a website is only source code. Dynamic data is encrypted and decentralised, to per-user storage nodes. This benefits <strong>free software</strong>, as well as <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>online privacy</strong>.

<h2>Hacky Holidays</h2>
<h3>Win one of three desirable plug servers!</h3>
In his seminal call to arms in the spring of 2010, Eben Moglen explained how the world would be a better place if everybody owned a plug server. These are fully functional (web-)servers, yet they are so small that they're built entirely into one little box with plug poles, that you plug straight into the wallsocket. We particularly like the Tonido plug, but you can pick any other model if you prefer a different one, as long as it's available and roughly equivalent. Some examples are PogoPlug and Guru Plug. It's probably the most geeky gadget that ever existed! We will send it to you with an Unhosted storage node installed so you can become the first citizen of the global Unhosted ecosystem.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>What you have to do to win</h3>
Download the source code of <a href="https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/unhosted/tree/v0.1" target="_blank">Unhosted alpha version 0.1</a>. Follow the instructions in the README file to get started with the three examples that come with it. Then get inspiration from the three categories below, and start hacking! Submit whatever you come up with before or on 1 January 2011. We're giving away one plug server for each category. However, you can submit your entry without specifying a category. We will judge all apps on all categories, and then pick three winning entries. The judging will be done on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unhosted" target="_blank">mailing list</a>. So here are the categories:
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Hacky Holidays, Everybody! evangelism:</h3>
Make unhosted more convincing to a wider public, with attractive presentation and convincing, easy-to-understand arguments. Even though unhosted is non-profit, its success or failure depends on how we sell it. This can be an interactive demo that explains the difference between hosted and unhosted, a convincing speech about the end of the world, an infographic that everybody understands, an unhosted blogpost on your blog, or whatever you feel could help unhosted appear cool, life-saving, and indispensible.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Hacky Holidays, WebDevs! cool apps:</h3>
Be the first person to write an unhosted twitter, chat, farmville, poker, forum, webmail, whatever you can hack together with your web development and JavaScript skills. You can use hello-world-blog as a starting point.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>Hacky Holidays, Geeks! protocol improvements:</h3>
The <a href="protocol.html">UJ/0.1 protocol</a> and the <a href="StarSign.html">StarSign0.1 pki</a> are very basic, and there many things that can (and probably should) be added to it. Like support for federation, compatibility with CCN, improvement of security, designing a browser-to-browser discovery/friending mechanism.
<br><br>
These are just suggestions. You are encouraged to compete in more than one category, to increase your chances of winning one of the three desirable plug servers. Submit your entry to <a href="mailto:contests+hh@unhosted.org">contests+hh@unhosted.org</a>. Mention 'Hacky Holidays Competition' in the subject line, and inside the email body give ample explanation of what you've done and what hurdles you encountered along the way. Deadline: New Year's Day 2011.
