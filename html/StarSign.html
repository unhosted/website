<h2>The StarSign pki<h2>
<h3>public key infrastructure</h3>
For asymmetric encryption, you need a public key. Your public key helps your subscribers know that what you publish was really written by you. It also serves for people to send private messages to you. For these two purposes, you want to publish your public key. But this leads to a problem: I know I can trust what you publish, based on the public key you published, but how can I trust the public key itself? This chicken-and-egg problem is solved by public key infrastructures (pki's). A pki generally involves a third party signing your key. With the signature, your subscribers know that (unless the third party was hacked), they can trust that it really is your public key. 
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>hierarchical pki's</h3>
There are basically two types of pki: hierarchical and distributed. In a hierarchical pki, the third party is some expensive company like VeriSign or Thawte, that we all trust because that's what these companies specialize in. The problem with hierarchical pki's is they use a central authority that introduces a single point of failure, and a single point of power. Https uses a pki like this, with the result that usually only commercial websites can be used over https, and small and not-for-profit ones can't. 
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>distributed pki's</h3>
In a distributed pki, people sign the public keys of their friends and personal contacts, ideally at real-world events (signing parties), and as long as there is a path from you, through a friend-of-a-friend ("foaf"), of a friend, of a friend, etcetera, to me, I can check that your public key is signed with a key, that is signed with a key, etcetera, on to a key that is signed by myself. The trouble with distributed pki's like this is that people need to take the effort of signing keys, and if you meet someone new, you need (probably centralized) graph algorithms to find the foaf-paths that connect you, and such a path may not exist. In fact, PGP is a good example of a distributed pki in which a foaf-path almost never exists, because it's just too much hassle for people to use PGP. An additional drawback is that you probably need to expose your social graph to increase the chance of your friends finding foaf-paths, and your list of friends (the list of keys you signed) may convey private information about you.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>are you who you say you are?</h3>
Signing a public key certifies that you believe that that key belongs to the online indentity you're signing it to. Online identity can mean three things in this context, though.
<ul>
<li>The weakest meaning is just the identifying string (probably a globally unique identifying string or "guid"), like a domainname, an email address, a twitter handle, etcetera.
<li>The second one would be the guid, plus the understanding that the website, mailbox, or twitter account behind that guid "has not been hacked". This is actually a vague concept. For instance, maybe the person using that guid is himself, and always has been, a malicious hacker. By playing nice for some time, the guid has gained online acceptance as a party you want to interact with, and then suddenly, they rear their ugly head. But the public key really is, unmistakably, the public key pertaining to that (malicious) guid.
<li> The third and strongest interpretation would be that the guid points to a specific real-world entity, like a physical person, a company, or an organization. This then also quietly implies that that physical person or company is one that you would want to trust, and that since you trust that real-world entity, you can trust the guid. That is a subjective notion, again, and it's unrelated to the question whether the public key is correct for that guid.
</ul>
In this context, we don't look at all these implications of trustworthiness, we only look at linking public keys to their corresponding guids. If the person behind that guid then turns out to be a bad person and a lier, then that's not the fault of the pki.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>antecedent guids</h3>
StarSign is neither hierarchical nor foaf-based. It works by defining a fabric in which every guid has its coordinates. <technical bit> These fabric coordinates are defined by closeness, and by antecedents:
<ul>
<li>We write all guids as US-ASCII strings, take their sha1 hashes, and interpret these as bitstrings.
<li>Two guids are 'close' to each other if they have a long common prefix (their sha1 bitstrings, that is), and they only differ in the last part of their bitstrings.
<li>A bitstring's n-th 'antecedent string' is what you get by flipping its n-th bit, and leaving all other bits as they are.
<li>Your n-th antecedent guid is the guid that is 'closest' to your n-th 'antecedent string'. So flip your n-th bit, and then change only the last few bits.
</ul>
We will use antecedent guids to traverse the StarSign fabric in a deterministic way. To find a path from guid1 to guid2, first check if their first bit is the same. If it's not, jump to guid1's first antecedent. Then check if the second bit of the current point is the same - if not, jump to the second antecedent. Etcetera, until all bits are the same, and you reached your destination. If one of the steps in the chain is not responding, you can skip that bitposition first, and try an alternative route by ironing out subsequent bits first, and then coming back to the bit you skipped. </technical bit>
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>starskeys and hutching</h3>
You sign the public keys that your antecedent guids present to you, and publish the (guid, StarSign)-pairs in your "stars" key. You notify the other guid, so when they receive it, they can check it, and also consider whether you would be a good antecedent for them. If everybody does this, then everybody will have a starskey containing stars for all of their own antecedents. This starskey will help anyone, no matter where they are in the StarSign fabric, to check the validity of your public key: from your starskey, they pick the antecedent that irons out the next bit, increasing the prefix in common with themselves. Then they check the correctness of the signature, and retrieve the starskey of that user (probably a perfect stranger, but relevant here simply because of his position in the StarSign fabric), and repeat. Whenever you meet someone new, you need to do this once, and then you can safely note down that contact's public key in your private addressbook. At first, the last bits will be jumping around a little while you're getting the first bits right, but there is always a 'last neighbour prefix', which is the minimal prefix that is unique to guid2. Once you have that, you know you have guid2. Since everybody signs the keys of their antecedent guids, this path constitutes a chain-of-trust. I call this "hutching" someone (in meme-rhyme with 'starskey'). It can be hidden from the end-user, true to unhosted's "zero-ux" principle. If someone wanted to hack your account, and start announcing a different public key in your name, then he would also have to hack all your antecedents, and their antecedents, etcetera, because they will be independent witnesses to your old public key. Everybody's security is linked to everybody else through the fabric.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3>first contact</h3>
When you first join the StarSign fabric (as a new user), you have not signed any keys yet, nor has anyone signed your key, so you need to go find your antecedents and "settle in" into your position in the fabric. Presumably you know at least one other guid (otherwise you have no need to participate there). From his starskey, you can work your way back to each of your antecedent points, and that way you immediately find your optimal antecedents. You should also recommend yourself to them, because you as a newcomer will probably be an improvement to the antecedents they had before. <technical bit> And you should recommend your own low antecedents to your own high antecedents, because you are close to them. </technical bit> Whenever you accept an antecedent, you sign their public key, and add their guid, along with your signature, to your starskey. I used the sha1 hashing to make it harder to "embush" someone. If it would be easy to find someone's perfect antecedents, you could create all of these, and present them to both the victim, and to his current antecedents. This way, you can change his public key towards the outside, yet not towards the inside and cover up the evidence of whatever you will be doing to your victim (probably stage a man-in-the-middle attack). To prevent this, I use sha1, which I understand is a non-reversible hash function, to go from user-friendly guid strings to the bitstrings. You could, however register so many guids onto the grid that you end up owning such a large percentage of guids, then you could still end up owning the full antecedent list of some real users, and stage embushes that way. For now, 'guid-flooding' is the only vulnerability I see, but I'm not a security expert, so I'm interested in the reactions of people who know more about this than me.

<h3>unhosted</h3>
This pki has come about as part of the "unhosted" project (http://www.unhosted.org/unhosted.html and @unhosted on twitter). Please email any reactions to our mailing list, groups.google.com/group/unhosted, or to michiel at unhosted.org; I'm very interested in what people think of this. Please also be ready for our "Hacky Holidays" competition (15-31 December 2010), in which you can win one of three desirable plug servers, simply by writing your own cool unhosted app during the holidays.
