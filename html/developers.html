					<h2>Freedom from web 2.0's monopoly platforms</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Unhosted is a project for strengthening free software against hosted software</strong>. With our protocol, a website is only source code. Dynamic data is encrypted and decentralised, to per-user storage nodes. This benefits <strong>free software</strong>, as well as <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>online privacy</strong>.

<h2>Join our Revolution</h2>
<h3>Develop your apps for the unhosted web</h3>
To make an unhosted web app, you need to download the <a href="https://github.com/DanielG/unhosted.js" target="_blank">unhosted.js</a> JavaScript library, and include it into your web application. It exposes functions to let the user login and access the various unhosted services that this user brings along. Using these unhosted user services for dynamic functionality and persistent storage, you as the software publisher only have to take care of static hosting of your html, css and js files.
<br><br>
If you want to change or develop the actual unhosted.js library, you'll need some more details about how the WebFinger-based discovery mechanism works, and how the various unhosted user services work (currently: KeyValue and MessageQueues). Also, if you want to develop an unhosted storage node like <a href="http://github.com/michiel-unhosted/balimich/" target="_blank">balimich</a>, you will need the exact specs of what the protocol for these services looks like on the wire. We are still working on the documentation for this - please drop by on the mailing list or in the IRC channel if you have any specific questions or suggestions.
<br><br>
If you want to get involved in developing the unhosted.js library, you can send your pull requests to its maintainer, <a href="https://github.com/DanielG/" target="_blank">DanielG</a>. If you would like to add discovery mechanisms to the unhosted web, defining new types of unhosted user services, or improving existing ones, then first please open a thread on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/unhosted" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, and also track your progress there, and on the wiki.
<br><br>
<h3>Help out with Unhosted Libre Office</h3>
We are working to get an 'export to my unhosted account' button into LibreOffice. Right now, we have the plan for how we want to do it, but we're looking for a C/C++ programmer who would like to actually implement it. The concept is <a href="http://vimeo.com/21387223" target="_blank">here</a>. Please volunteer to code this!
