<h2>2. Purpose of the Association</h2> 
The Association’s purpose is to make the web shift from hosted apps towards unhosted apps. 
More specifically:
<ol> 
  <li> publish an open standard that can form the basis of the unhosted web.
  </li>
  <li> provide tools that help people develop unhosted web apps
  </li>
  <li> make sure there are good providers of both public and private unhosted accounts for end users to choose from
  </li>
  <li> convince web devs that they want to migrate their web apps to the unhosted web
  </li>
  <li> lead by example
  </li>
  <li> deal with miscellaneous organizational issues that allow us to work on the above points
  </li>
</ol>
 
     Amendment of the association’s purpose may only be made in accordance
  with § 3 (1).
 
<a name="3"></a> 
<h2>3. Non-profit Association</h2> 
 
<ol> 
  <li>The activities of the Association are exclusively and directly limited to
  non-profit activities as stipulated in § 2 of the Articles of Association and
  to tax-privileged purposes in accordance with §§ 51ff. AO (German Tax
  Regulations). Its activities are for the common good and are not pursued
  primarily for the purpose of profit making.</li> 
 
  <li>The Association’s financial means may only be used for purposes
  stipulated in the Articles of Association. Members will only be reimbursed
  for their expenses but will not receive any direct benefits out of the
  Association’s funds.</li> 
 
  <li>It is not permitted to favour somebody through association expenditures,
  which do not serve the associations purpose or are disproportionately high.
  Reimbursements for expenditures are made in accordance with the Federal
  Travel Expenses Code should no other legal regulations apply.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<a name="4"></a> 
<h2>4. Types of Membership and Members of the Association</h2> 
 
<ol> 
  <li>Both natural persons and legal bodies wanting to implement and promote
  the aims of the association may become members. Taking into account the
  international character of the Association and to give members the
  possibility to stop actively supporting and developing the unhosted web without
  necessarily losing their membership, the following types of memberships are
  available:
 
  <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
    <li><b>Active members</b> are natural persons supporting the Association’s
    purpose and aims through their cooperation and who in doing so take over
    the complete duties of an association member. Primarily, they are expected
    to cooperate, participate in the general assembly and exercise their voting
    rights.</li> 
 
    <li><b>Extraordinary members </b>are natural persons and legal bodies, who
    through their membership declare their support of the Association’s
    purposes and aims, while refraining from voting rights and the exertion of
    the active members’ right to participate in the general assemblies. Legal
    bodies chose a representative to exercise the remaining rights and
    duties.</li> 
 
    <li><b>Supporting Members</b> are extraordinary members supporting the
    Association’s
    purposes and aims primarily through financial or material contributions. If
    desired, their names will be published on the Association’s website, and
    they have the right to participate in the general meetings. They do not
    have any voting rights.</li> 
  </ol></li> 
 
  <li><p>An active membership will be granted if suggested by a member and
  supported by two other active members, if the general meeting decides to
  grant it or if a simple majority of the active members is obtained by means
  of an internet vote. The main criterion for granting membership should be the
  candidate’s commitment over a longer period of time and the contributions
  he/she made in order to fulfil the Association’s aims.</p> 
 
  <p>An active member can change status to that of an extraordinary member by
  submitting his request to the Board. Should an active member not fulfil the
  above mentioned duties over a period of two consecutive general meetings, the
  membership will automatically change into an extraordinary membership. An
  extraordinary member, but not a supporting member, can submit an application to become
  an active member to the Board. The Board decides whether or not to accept a
  supporting member.</p></li> 
 
  <li>The membership terminates due to exit, expulsion, death, or – in the case
  of legal bodies – due to the loss of its legal status. The membership may be
  terminated on December 31<sup>st</sup> of each year, and a written request
  has to be submitted to the Board at least 4 weeks prior.</li> 
 
  <li><p>The expulsion of a member is reserved for critical situations, and
  generally it will be considered preferable to find a peaceful solution. The
  expulsion becomes effective immediately after the Board’s decision. The
  following reasons may cause an expulsion:</p> 
 
  <ol type="a"> 
    <li>if a member seriously violates regulations contained in the Articles of
    Association and/or the purpose and aim of the Association, and an attempt
    to clarify the situation was unsuccessful; and</li> 
 
    <li>if the membership fees are not paid over a period of 12 months despite
    repeated reminders.</li> 
  </ol> 
 
  <p>Before such a decision will be taken, the member must have the opportunity
  to justify or explain his/her actions. An objection to such an expulsion may
  be filed with the Board within four weeks and will be voted on during the
  next general meeting. Until such decision will be taken by the general
  meeting, the member’s rights and duties remain dormant.</p></li> 
 
  <li>If a member leaves the Association or the Association is liquidated, no
  member has a right of reimbursement for the assets he/she may have
  contributed.</li> 
</ol>

(1) Members are entitled to participate in all events sponsored by the association. 
They are furthermore entitled to file motions with the Board and the Members' Assembly.

<h2>5. Organs of the Association</h2> 
 
<p>The organs of the Association are:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>the General Assembly and</li> 
  <li>the Board.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<a name="6"></a> 
<h2>6. General Assembly</h2> 
 
<ol> 
  <li>The General Assembly consists of all of the Association’s active members,
  who have one vote.</li> 
 
  <li>The General Assembly takes place at least once a year. The Board invites
  the members per mail or email, providing a preliminary agenda. The invitation
  has to be sent at least six weeks prior to the meeting. The time limit starts
  on the day after the invitation letter was sent. The date of the post mark
  and the date when the email was sent are binding. The invitation letter is
  considered as delivered, if it was addressed to the last address the member
  advised in writing. The members may submit additional agenda items to the
  board either in writing or electronically until two weeks before the assembly.
  The date when the letter or email
  was received is binding. The Board will publish the final agenda in the
  internet, and the address is to be mentioned in the written invitation. </li> 
 
  <li>If it is in the Association’s interest, an extraordinary General Assembly
  may be called for. If this request is submitted to the Board in written form
  by at least 20% of the members, the Board is compelled to call for an
  extraordinary General Assembly within six weeks. The member’s request must
  contain the desired agenda item.</li> 
 
  <li>Independent from the number of members present, the General Assembly only
  has a quorum if the invitation was submitted in proper form. It nominates one
  of the members present as head of the General Assembly. Unless otherwise
  decided by the General Assembly, all decisions will be taken openly by show
  of hands and with a simple majority. If the number of pro and contra
  votes should be equal, the application is considered as dismissed.</li> 
 
  <li>Differing from (4), a majority of ¾ of the votes of the General Assembly
  and a minimum of half of the votes of all active members are necessary to
  amend the Articles of Association or decide the liquidation of the
  Association.</li> 
 
  <li>An active member who cannot personally participate in the General
  Assembly may ask another member, who will be personally present, to represent
  him during the General Assembly. The representative will exercise both
  members’ voting rights. The representative will legitimise himself at the
  beginning of the General Assembly by presenting to the Board the original
  of a written authorisation. A representative may represent a maximum of two
  additional members.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<a name="7"></a> 
<h2>7. Duties of the General Assembly</h2> 
 
<ol> 
  <li><p>The General Assembly is the highest decision making organ of the
  Association and is generally in charge of all duties, unless these Articles
  of Association have assigned specific duties to another organ of the
  Association.</p> 
  <p>The General Assembly elects the board from a number of active members. The
  people obtaining the largest numbers of votes will be elected. Ballot papers will be
  provided to cast the votes.</p></li> 
 
  <li>The General Assembly may deselect a board member. Differing from (1),
  this process requires the majority of votes of all active members.</li> 
 
  <li>The General Assembly decides about the objections of members the Board
  intends to expel.</li> 
 
  <li>The General Assembly receives the Board’s annual report as well as the
  audit report of the auditor and discharges the board’s responsibilities.</li> 
 
  <li>The right to decide about amendments to the Articles of Association or a
  liquidation of the association is reserved to the General Assembly.</li> 
 
  <li>Namely the annual accounts and the annual report have to be presented in
  written format to the General Assembly for decision making and discharge of
  the board. It calls on two auditors, who belong neither to the board nor any
  other panel appointed by the board and who are not employed by the
  association, in order to audit the accounting and annual report and relate
  their results to the General Assembly. The auditors have access to all of the
  Association’s accounting documents.</li> 
 
  <li>Furthermore the General Assembly has the exclusive right to decide
  about:
 
  <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
    <li>any purchase of, sale of or charges on real property,</li> 
    <li>any investment in other companies and</li> 
    <li>raising loans of EUR 10,000 and more</li> 
  </ol></li> 
 
  <li>It has the right to decide about all matters board or members submit to
  it.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<a name="8"></a> 
<h2>8. The Board</h2> 
 
<ol> 
  <li>The Board consists of 5 persons, and only natural persons can be board
  members. They are elected for a 3 years term. Re-election is permitted. The
  respective board members remain in office after expiration of their term
  until a successor is elected.</li> 
 
  <li>From its midst the Board elects a chairman and two proxies. One of the
  proxies is the treasurer. Re-election is permitted.</li> 
 
  <li>The Board’s duties, namely all regulations pertaining to calling for
  board meetings, meeting procedures and voting process are stipulated in the
  by-laws of the board, which it has to decide unanimously.</li> 
 
  <li>The board decides about all matters pertaining to the association, unless
  a decision of the General Assembly is required. It implements the decisions
  taken by the General Assembly.</li> 
 
  <li>Each individual board member has the right to represent the Association
  to outside parties.</li> 
 
  <li>Should a board member quit while in office, the board appoints a
  provisional board member on the basis of an internet vote in which all active
  members participate. The provisional board member remains in office until the
  General Assembly takes place. The General Assembly decides about the definite
  succession within the board.</li> 
 
  <li>In accordance with §30 BGB (German Civil Code) the board can decide to
  appoint a full-time director as a special representative, who manages all of
  the Association’s current affairs and acts as supervisor of the Association’s
  full-time employees. Decisions pertaining to work contracts, dismissal and
  admission of new members may only be taken by the board.</li> 
 
  <li>The director is committed to participate in the General Assemblies and
  has the right or duty (if the board demands it) to participate in the board
  meetings. He has the right of speech in all meetings and is accountable to
  all organs of the association.</li> 
 
  <li>Amendments to the Articles of Association demanded by regulatory, court
  or financial authorities for formal reasons may be undertaken by the board.
  The General Assembly has to be informed of such amendments in its next
  meeting.</li> 
</ol> 





§ 10a Decision-making by the Board

(1) The Board decides by majority vote. The Board has quorum if at least half of its members 
participate in the vote. If there is an equal number of votes for and against a motion, the 
motion fails. A motion is considered adopted if there have been more votes submitted for than 
against. Abstentions and invalid votes are considered as not submitted.

(2) The Board may decide at meetings, phone conferences or through online voting. Decisions 
made through online voting are only allowed, if the identity of the participant is guaranteed 
by appropriate authentication methods (e.g. login and password).

(3) Invitations for a meeting must be effected at least seven days prior, for phone conferences 
at least two days prior to their start. Provision of an agenda may be omitted. Invitations 
must be effected by the President. He may name a representative if needed. If at least two 
members of the Board so request, motions submitted for a phone conference must be conducted 
as decisions during a meeting or through online voting. In these cases, the motion may not 
be decided upon during a phone conference. Decisions of the Board are documented in the meeting minutes.

(4) Each member of the Board has the right to create motions for the Board's decision in 
the Board's wiki and propose a vote on them through online voting. This right also applies 
to the Executive Director provided that such a decision is necessary for sustaining or 
developing the chapter's operations or the approval of the Board is required. The decision-making 
process starts at the point in time when the sponsor of the motion has informed the Board 
via mailing list about the proposal and has requested its participation. The decision-making 
process consists of a discussion period followed by a voting period. The voting period regularly 
lasts seven days, but at least three days. Voting periods of less than seven days may only 
be ordered by the President and only for important reasons. The end of the voting period 
shall be determined by the Secretary.

(5) Further details shall be determined by the Board's rules of procedure.


§ 11 Internal auditors

Through the annual Members' Assembly, two internal auditors shall be elected for a term of 
one year. The internal auditors shall have the responsibility to audit the financial records 
as well as their proper accounting and the use of funds and thereby to especially determine 
the proper use of funds according to the charter and tax law. The audit does not encompass 
the usefulness of expenditures by the Board. The internal auditors shall report the result 
of their audits to the Members's Assembly. The internal editors may not be members of the 
Board or a committee appointed by the Board and they may not be employees of the association.


§ 12 Dissolution of the association

(1) After dissolution of the association or revocation of its prior charitable purposes, 
the assets of the association shall be disbursed to a corporation under public law or a tax-exempt 
corporation for the purpose of promoting education as defined in the charter. The Members's 
Assembly shall determine the receiver jointly with the motion to dissolve the association.

(2) The current Board members with representative rights shall be named as liquidators if the 
Members' Assembly does not finally decide otherwise.









 
<a name="9"></a> 
<h2>9. By-Laws</h2> 
 
<p>The by-laws govern all details of the Associations activities which are not 
covered in the Articles of Association. The Board implements the by-laws following 
the members approval. The members' approval is obtained by means of an internet 
vote and a simple majority of the active members.</p> 




10 Arbitration clause
10.1 Should there be disagreement between members and the association, so are the parties 
to seek an amicable solution.

10.2 If there is no amicable solution between the parties, the disagreement is to be taken 
to a private arbitration court in order to prevent ordinary and expensive arbitration in 
state court. The private arbitration court consists of two referees (party's representative) 
and a chairman, the contending parties each choose their representative within two weeks 
and elect a chairman within three weeks, from amongst the other members of the association. 
Should this time-frame not be sufficient for one or more parties, the board appoints. Should 
the arbitration court not come to a satisfying conclusion for one or more parties, then it 
also decides on the division of costs for legislating in ordinary court.

11 Amendment to the Statutes
11.1 Changing the Statutes can only be decided at the General Members Meeting by two-third 
of the votes cast. If fewer members attend the General Members Meeting, the next General 
Members Meeting can decide regardless of the number of attendees or votes cast, by a two-third 
majority of attendees' votes.

11.2 All proposals for changes to the Statutes are sent to each member at least one month 
prior to the General Members Meeting. This does not include changes proposed during the General Members Meeting.

11.3 Any decision on the amendment to the Statute, before its application to be registered 
at the court office, is to be submitted to the competent Financial Department. If the Finance 
Department submits fiscal concerns, the decision on the amendment automatically renders ineffective.
