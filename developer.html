      <h1>How to develop unhosted web apps</h1>
      <p>
        Previously we would present "do it with Unhosted" as a sort of platform that includes a client and a server. Now, we say 'unhosted web apps' are web apps that live in the browser and
        do not have their own server-side part. That is, if server-side functionality is needed, for instance for communication or persistence, then this is considered part of the app's environment,
        and not of the app itself. We have a few other tips and tricks on this page, and want to
        evolve this page to a general summary of the developer resources and tools that are relevant when you are developing your unhosted web app.

		 <h2>RemoteStorageJs</h2>
     Our main tool here for storing user data from an unhosted web app is the 'remote storage' standard.
     It allows a user to connect a compatible storage server with a compatible unhosted web app. So your app stores data to a remote storage server
     that is <strong>owned by the user, not by the app developer</strong>. So this is a big paradigm shift!
     To create apps that allow users to connect their remote storage, we recommend you use <a href="http://remotestorage.io/">RemoteStorageJs</a>. 
     It's the equivalent of iCloud for unhosted web apps. It is still in developer preview, but already provides the following modules:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contacts</strong> - for accessing a user's addressbook in the cloud</li>
      <li><strong>Documents</strong> - same for their documents</li>
      <li><strong>Tasks</strong> - for all types of productivity management</li>
      <li><strong>Calendar</strong> - one calendar across all unhosted web apps</li>
      <li><strong>Money</strong> - this module grew out of <a href="http://opentabs.net">Opentabs</a> and <a href="http://webcredits.org">WebCredits</a></li>
      <li><strong>Root</strong> - &quot;access all areas&quot;, useful for account migrations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Unhosted Unconference</h2>
    <h4>Weekend of 7-9 September 2012, near Prague (CZ)</h4>
    <p>
    If you're near Prague this September, then don't miss <a href="http://2012.unhosted.org/">The Unhosted Unconference</a>. It's an unorganized get-together in a village in the hills of Central Bohemia which was named after it. The wifi is flaky and the Pilsener beer is very cheap. ClubMate will be transported from Berlin by train for the occasion. The rest is up to you.

      <h2>Firefox as your phone</h2>
    <p>
    People developing iPhone apps are one big competitor and talent drain of the open web.
    Solution: We have to make the web as good as Apple's proprietary platform.
    With <a href="http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/07/02/firefox-mobile-os/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a>, Mozilla strikes back 
    in defense of the open web and launches its own smartphone and tablet platform.
    Entirely open. Entirely based on html and javascript. Firefox OS is based on Boot2Gecko, which is basically Firefox mobile on a very
    stripped-down Android extract, and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI">WebAPI</a>,
    an endeavour to expose all device functionality to javascript as simple DOM interfaces.

    <h2>5apps for packaging and deployment</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of rapidly changing formats and technologies to package a html5-based app for distribution to an app store and onto a device. <a href="https://5apps.com/">5apps</a> is a very handy tool that takes your mind off the various manifest files and allows you to focus on just the app itself. To deploy, simply type 'git push 5apps master' from your repo. The rest is automatic.
