      <h2>15. Unhosted web apps and OAuth</h2>

<!-- unhosted oauth: Unhosted web apps and OAuth. -->
<h3>The unhosted approach to OAuth</h3>
<p>OAuth is a very important recent development on the open web, and maybe partially because of that, also a
  <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/03/22/1439235/a-truckload-of-oauth-issues-that-would-make-any-author-quit">troubled</a> one.</p>
<p>Making hosted applications interact with each other in such a way that the user understands the security model is not easy. Many casual users of the web don't
  understand what a server is, so it's not easy to explain to them that two instead of one servers will now have access to their data, and what that means.</p>
<p>In this episode of the handbook, we're going to help make the confusion even worse. :) We're going to use unhosted applications to interact with the APIs of hosted ones.</p>

<h3>Terms of Service</h3>
<p>One of the reasons that hosted software presents a fundamental violation of software freedom is that the user needs to agree to terms of service which are often
unreasonable. Even
though we are creating unhosted software that can replace most hosted software, hosted applications will likely still exists for some time to come, so
we set up a project where we review the terms of service of all the big hosted applications, and rate them for how well they respect consumer rights. It's called
  <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service; Didn't Read</a>, and is now an independent project with its own donations budget, run by community of volunteers, and a team
  lead by Hugo.</p>
<p>To make the reviewing process easier, we decided we want to build a web form that directly creates pull requests on the github repo of the website. The tosdr.org website
is made up of html, generated from json files using a build script. Previously, it was an unhosted web app, but since this was slow to load in most browsers, and the prominent
use case for the website is to access the reviews as read-only documents, we moved the scripts into the build script. The site is still entirely client-side; it is hosted
as static content on 5apps.</p>
<p>This means it's not currently possible to edit the website without using a git client. In fact, since the other contributors to the project are not members of the No Cookie
  Crew, contributing to ToS;DR (both editing the website and participating in comment threads) requires me to log in to github. So far in the preceding episodes we have 
  discussed how to give up hosted applications like GMail, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter, and how to give up native applications like Skype and Spotify, but github is still
  a platform we rely on every day in the life of an unhosted web app developer.</p>

<h3>Cross-origin access to github</h3>
<p>Github exposes an API with which you can do, by the looks of it, everything you can do via its web and git interfaces. For instance, you can create a blog, create a commit,
  and create a pull request to suggest a change to the code in a github repo. This is exactly what we need for tosdr.org.</p>
<p>At first I started adding github as a platform to sockethub, but later I realised that if we use a non-branded OAuth client, plus the 
  <a href="https://blog.5apps.com/2013/03/02/new-service-cors-ssl-proxy.html">5apps cors proxy</a>, then we don't need anything else. It is possible to access github from an
  unhosted web app, without using sockethub. Let me explain how it works.</p>
<p>In order to access the github API, you need to register an app. This gives you a client_id and a client_secret. The
  <a href="http://developer.github.com/guides/basics-of-authentication/">documentation</a> says you should never, ever, publish your client secret. The name 'client secret'
  also obviously implies this. :) However, this is part of a security model where a hosted application gets access to github. The word 'client' here refers to the second
  hosted application being a client when connecting to the github API.</p>
<p>Some APIs, like for instance the <a href="http://developers.flattr.net/api/">Flattr API</a>, offer cross-origin access, using the same technique as remoteStorage:
  OAuth implicit grant flow to obtain a bearer token, and then CORS headers on the API responses to allow cross-origin ajax from the client-side.</p>
<p>Whereas Flattr supports the implicit grant flow like intended by the authors of the OAuth spec, Dropbox offers OAuth 1.0, and suggests you publish your client secret.
  Github tells you not to expose your client secret, but does not provide a reason (as Jan suggested, I asked them about this, I'll update this as soon as they reply.</p>
<p>In order to stop a third party from pretending to be us, I used an anonymous app registration, in a github account that I created specifically for this purpose
  naming the app '(unknown)' and pointing it to http://example.com/. The only thing I filled in correctly in the app registration is the redirect location, so that the user
  is redirected to our web form on tosdr.org when they authorize the app.</p>
<p>At first, the redirect will provide an access code, which still has to be exchanged for an access token. We do this as follows, using the 5apps CORS proxy. Note that
  despite the fact that github says you should never, ever do this, I put the client secret into the client-side code:
<pre><code>
    var githubClient = {
      id: '3365a610f873704cff3a',
      secret: 'e9b3c5161bf15a2518046e95d64efc880afcfc58',
      proxy1: 'https://cors.5apps.com/?uri=https://github.com',
      proxy2: 'https://cors.5apps.com/?uri=https://api.github.com'
    };
    function post(path, payload, cb) {
      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open('POST', githubClient.proxy1+path, true);
      xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
      xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Length', payload.length);
      xhr.onload = function () {
        console.log(xhr.status);
        console.log(xhr.responseText);
      }
      xhr.send(payload);
    }
    function extractParam(key) {
      var pairs = location.search.substring(1).split('&');
      for(var i=0; i<pairs.length; i++) {
        var kv = pairs[i].split('=');
        if(decodeURIComponent(kv[0])==key) {
          return decodeURIComponent(kv[1]);
        }
      }
    }
    function codeToToken() {
      var code = extractParam('code');
      if(code) {
        post('/login/oauth/access_token',
          'client_id='+githubClient.id+'&client_secret='+githubClient.secret
          +'&code='+code, function(){
        });
      }
    }
    codeToToken();
</code></pre>
<p>I haven't written the code for the whole pull request creation yet, but at least the access to github is working with this.</p>

<h3>The future.</h3>
<p>That's it, for the basics! With this episode, we completed the first part of our handbook. None of it is finished, but it should give a first direction for all the topics
we covered. I'll probably keep writing weekly blog posts here, I thought about maybe doing a more in-depth review of all kinds of background knowledge, like a sort of
textbook, but highlighting for each topic how it is relevant to unhosted web apps, and then linking to more detailed resources of all the related fields. Things like
encryption, DHTs, networking considerations, and other related technologies. After that, the third part would be about data domains (so basically all the remoteStorage
modules and all the sockethub platforms), then a part about building apps (discussing things like MVC), and then some assorted topics to round off. I've made a rough
estimation that the total handbook will be about 52 episodes, so I can take one year to fill it up week by week. :)</p>
<p>You may have followed the discussion about whether the No Cookie Crew is useful at all, or whether we should take a more pragmatic approach to dogfooding, concentrating
only on a few specific apps. I talked a lot about this with Nick, Basti, Niklas, Jan, Martin and Pavlik, and my conclusion is more or less that we'll move the strict
approach of the No Cookie Crew to the background a little bit, in favor of the more pragmatic dogfooding of apps like Litewrite and Dogtalk, but I think there is a place
for both approaches.</p>
<p>In terms of marketing, this means unhosted web apps have basically 3 or 4 concentric markets:
<ul>
<li>the strict No Cookie Crew market, a bit like Richard Stallman on free desktop software, or vegans on food, users in this market use only unhosted web apps for all their
computing needs, unless there is an explicit an identifiable need to break that principle.</li>
<li>the dogfooders market, people who are actively involved in developing unhosted web apps and their accompanying tools, and who will go through extra effort to try out
unhosted web apps where they exist.</li>
<li>the early adopters market, people who will try out unhosted web apps, but who will not keep using them if they don't work well.</li>
<li>the general public, people who would probably not know the difference between an unhosted web app and a hosted one, and who would use unhosted web apps almost
"by accident", only if they are good apps by their own merit. Compare this for instance with the many users who use Firefox as their browser, but who don't know that
unlike the other major browsers, Firefox is published by a non-profit organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have been talking about unhosted web apps for about two years now, and have been trying to build some useful remoteStorage-based apps for about one year.
We are still only at the beginning of unhosted web apps actually being used in production in any of these four markets. But the future looks bright. I think our movement
will keep growing both in number of developers involved, and in market reach of the unhosted web apps we develop. If you're interested in joining, then let us know!</p>
<p>We are always looking for more talented app developers. If you develop an unhosted web app, then you can add it to the
<a href="https://unhosted.org/apps/">examples page</a>; most of the apps mentioned on there have issue trackers on github, so you can submit bug reports there if you
have any problems using any of the apps, and if you have any questions or remarks in general, then just send them to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unhosted">forum</a>. Comments very welcome!</p>

      <p>The next episode will appear on Tuesday 2 April, 2013.</p>    </article>
