    <h1>Yearly unconference</h1>
    If you're near Prague this September, then don't miss <a href="https://github.com/unhosted/website/wiki/Unhost12">The Unhosted Unconference</a>. It's an unorganized get-together in a village in the hills of Central Bohemia which was named after it. The wifi is flaky and the Pilsener beer is very cheap. ClubMate will be transported from Berlin by train for the occasion. The rest is up to you.

    <h1>Firefox as your phone</h1>
    <a style="margin:20%" href="http://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/07/02/firefox-mobile-os/" target="_blank"><img src="./ffos2.png" alt="Firefox OS" width="200"/></a> One big competitor of the open web is Apple iOS. Mozilla strikes back with its own smartphone and tablet platform. Entirely open. Entirely based on html and javascript. Firefox OS is based on Boot2Gecko, which is basically Firefox mobile on a very stripped-down Android extract, and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI">WebAPI</a>, an endeavour to expose all device functionality to javascript as simple DOM interfaces.
